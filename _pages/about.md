I'm a second year PhD student at <a href='https://mila.quebec/en' rel='external nofollow noopener' target='_blank'>Mila -- Quebec AI Institute</a> and <a href='https://diro.umontreal.ca' rel='external nofollow noopener' target='_blank'>Université de Montréal DIRO</a>, in <a href='http://guywolf.org' rel='external nofollow noopener' target='_blank'> Guy Wolf's group</a>.
My interests cover theory and applications of machine learning with a focus on graph representation learning and spectral graph theory.
In addition, I am interested in explainable AI (XAI), domain adaptation, out-of-distribution generalization & reinforcement learning.
More recently, I have been working on applying GRL on molecular data, improving the scalability of graph neural networks, and self-supervised learning on graphs.

I'm also an ML Engineer at <a href='https://zetane.com' rel='external nofollow noopener' target='_blank'>Zetane Systems</a>, where I focus on XAI and lead ML projects with clients and industry partners.

I completed my MSc also at Mila & UdeM, and previously obtained my BEng from the University of Pennsylvania (Penn).
I've previously interned at the <a href='https://www.imperial.ac.uk/data-science/' rel='external nofollow noopener' target='_blank'>Imperial College Data Science Institute</a> (distributed computing), <a href=' https://www.sas.com/en_us/home.html' rel='external nofollow noopener' target='_blank'>SAS Analytics</a> (data science) and <a href='https://infotron.com.tr/en/' rel='external nofollow noopener' target='_blank'>InfoTRON</a> (AR/VR).
